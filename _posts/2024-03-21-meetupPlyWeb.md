This evening, I attended the [Plymouth Web meetup](https://www.meetup.com/plymouth-web/events/) to expand my network. It was my first time on the Plymouth WEb meetup, the talks are interesting and impressive, especially Matthew's talk on his game, "Justicar's Scales," created during the GameOff Game Jam.

During my presentation, I showcased my profile website, built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Additionally, I shared some information on my game, "OhMyGod" developed for the Brackeys Game Jam. This presentation is out of my original plan, next time I will be well prepared, have gameplays to demonstrate, and more in-depth explanation behind the works.
