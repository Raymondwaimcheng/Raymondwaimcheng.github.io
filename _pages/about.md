Hi, I'm Raymond Cheng, A passionate gamer and game developer hailing from the bustling city of Hong Kong, currently pursuing my studies at the [University of Plymouth](https://www.plymouth.ac.uk/). With years of hands-on experience in Unity, Unreal Engine, Blender, Aseprite, Android Studio, as well as proficiency in programming languages like C#, C++, and Java, I'm well-equipped to turn my gaming passion into a career. Fluent in three languages and known for my ambition, easy-going nature, creativity, intelligence, and strong work ethic, I'm ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

Gaming has been my escape, my inspiration, and my obsession. I've immersed myself in every aspect of the gaming universe. But more than just a player, I've always been a creator at heart. I'm diving deep into the realm of computer science and game development, honing my skills and refining my craft on Unity and Unreal 5, brings me closer to realizing my dream of crafting unforgettable gaming experiences for players around the globe.

Outside of classes and coding sessions, you'll often find me spending hours playing games, lost in the captivating narratives of anime, experimenting with new flavors in the kitchen, or simply getting lost in the rhythm of my favorite tunes. These diverse interests not only fuel my creativity but also provide me with fresh perspectives and ideas to incorporate into my game design.

I thrive on the challenge of bringing worlds to life, creating characters that resonate with players, and crafting experiences that leave a lasting impression. With each project, I push myself to improve, innovate, to push boundaries, and to bring something truly unique to the table.

Sure, the road ahead may be filled with obstacles, but I relish the opportunity to overcome them. Every setback is a chance to learn, to grow, and to become a better developer.
