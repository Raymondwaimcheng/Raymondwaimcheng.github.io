You are one of the gods from the god company, which handles and manages the humans below, but you hate the job because you hate humans. One day, your coworker, Goddess, kindly asks you to help her handle a knight and guide him out of the dungeon. You think this is the chance to help you pursue her, so you take it...

The game is mainly controlled by the mouse, your job as the player is to manage your ability point to guide the knight out of any dangerous room and into the treasure/ supply room, until you find the room with a key which is the escape.

At the start, the Player has 5 Ability points, Knight Has 20hp, 

There are currently a few types of rooms:

Monster room, the player clicking the door will result in the knight taking damage, clicking the monster will make the knight sense danger and walk away but will consume 1 ability point.

Treasure room, the player clicking the door will result in the knight healing 5 hp

Trap room, the player clicking the door will result in the knight taking damage, clicking on the trap will make the knight sense danger and walk away but will consume 1 ability point

Special room(mimic room), the room is similar to the treasure room,  avoid by clicking on the knight to force the knight to leave but will consume 2 ability point, clicking the door will result in the knight taking huge damage.
